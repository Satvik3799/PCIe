## Introduction

The Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe) is a high-speed interface standard for connecting various hardware components in a computer system. This project explores the PCIe module IP provided by Xilinx and demonstrates its implementation and simulation using Vivado Design Suite.

## PCIe Overview

PCIe is widely used for connecting high-speed components such as graphics cards, solid-state drives, and network cards. It offers several advantages over older standards, including:

- Higher data transfer rates
- Improved scalability
- Lower latency
- Better error detection and correction mechanisms

## Project Description

This project involves:
- Implementing the PCIe module IP using Xilinx tools
- Creating a Vivado block design
- Simulating the design to verify functionality
- Analyzing the simulation results
